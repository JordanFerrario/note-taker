# Note Taker App (Because you need another one!)

## Description

Are you tired of using a pen and paper to jot down life's tasks? Maybe you're office is cluttered with sticky notes and loose scraps of paper with reminders like "Walk the dog!" or "Don't forget to do that really important thing somone reminded you of 1,000 times!" Well, ignore your iPhone notes app because I have the perfect digital solution to your problem. Introducing, **Note Taker App!** That's right, it does _exactly_ what the title suggests! With Note Taker App you can create, view, and delete all of the important (or not-so-important) to-dos, thoughts, and other information you choose to jot down.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Give your note a title and jot down whatever you want in the text box below. Seriously, whatever you want (as long as it's text)! Once you're done note taking, brainstorming, journaling, trauma dumping, or to-doing, simply click "Save Note" and see your note get added to the list on the left.
- **View Notes**: Click on a note title to view your note again. Revist cringey fan faction you decided to write down on your way home from work or bring up an old phone number you needed to remember because 10 digits is a lot! Whatever the case may be, all your notes are there for you when you need them.
- **Delete Notes**: Thought that fan fiction story was really that bad upon second read? Maybe that phone number has been disconnected or you realize he/she/they isn't going to call you back. Good news! Click on the red trash icon next to the note title in your notes list and that painful memory is gone (digitally, at least)!
- **Persistence**: It's 2024, you probably have multiple devices which in this case, is a good thing! Notes are saved in a JSON file on the server so you can access your notes across multiple sessions and devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js and uuidv4
- **Data Storage**: Notes are stored in a `db.json` file, simulating a database.
